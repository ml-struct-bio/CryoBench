# CryoBench: Diverse and challenging datasets for the heterogeneity problem in cryo-EM

## Documentation:

The latest documentation for CryoBench is available [homepage](https://cryobench.cs.princeton.edu/).

For any feedback, questions, or bugs, please file a Github issue, start a Github discussion, or email.

## Installation:

To run the script that calculates the neighborhood similarity, please first install [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

    # install jax
    $ pip install -U jax


## Neighborhood Similarity
The neighborhood similarity quantifies the percentage of matching neighbors with respect to the ground truth that are found within a neighborhood radius `k`.


### Example 
In the repo [metrics/neighborhood_similarity](https://github.com/ml-struct-bio/CryoBench/tree/main/metrics/neighborhood_similarity) , you can find `cal_neighb_hit_werror.py` that calculates the neighborhood similarity between ground truth embeddings and several sets of embeddings from reconstruction algorithms found in  `conf-het-1_wrangled_latents.npz`:

	$ python cal_neighb_hit_werror.py

The output files are the neighborhood similarity as a function of the neighborhood radius for each reconstruction algorithm.
